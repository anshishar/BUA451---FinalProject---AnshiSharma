# BUA451 Final Project – [Your First Name] [Your Last Name]

## Project Overview
This project was completed for BUA451. It explores a real-world dataset from BigQuery's public dataset catalog, conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applies predictive modeling techniques to uncover business-relevant insights.

## Dataset
- **Source**: `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
- **Description**: The dataset contains millions of Chicago taxi trip records, including details such as trip times, distances, fares, tips, pickup and dropoff locations, and payment types.

## Methods Applied
- **BigQuery SQL**: Used to filter, select, and prepare the dataset.
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly)**: Used for data visualization and EDA.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models were applied to predict tipping behavior.

## Key Findings
- There is a strong positive relationship between fare amounts and tip amounts.
- Trips paid by credit card tend to have higher tip percentages compared to cash payments.
- Logistic Regression performed better than a Decision Tree in predicting whether a tip would be given, achieving about 72% accuracy.

## Project Files
- `BUA451_FinalProject_[FirstNameLastName].ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with SQL queries, EDA, modeling, and analysis.
- `README.md`: Project description and overview.
- Visual assets (plots, figures) embedded within the Jupyter Notebook.

## Important Notes
- This repository is private.
- Collaborator **rthomas2296** has been added for review.
- The project includes an interactive visualization using Plotly.
