# BUA451 Final Project â€“ Anshi Sharma

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global country information using the public BigQuery dataset `bigquery-public-data.country_codes`. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), extract business-relevant insights, and apply a basic predictive model to the dataset. Visualizations were created to support understanding and communication of key patterns.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [BigQuery Public Dataset - Country Codes](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/bigquery-public-data/country-codes)
- **Description:**  
  Contains ISO-standard country codes, country names, regions, subregions, and related metadata for countries around the world.

## Methods
- Connected to BigQuery using Python and Google Cloud BigQuery API.
- Queried and explored the dataset using SQL.
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find trends and patterns across regions and subregions.
- Created visualizations using Seaborn and Plotly (including interactive charts).
- Built a basic Decision Tree model to simulate predictive modeling based on simple features.

## Key Findings
- Africa and Europe have the highest number of country entries in the dataset.
- Sub-Saharan Africa and Northern Europe are dominant subregions based on the number of listed countries.
- Predictive modeling based solely on country code properties is limited, highlighting the need for richer feature sets in serious international business modeling.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-Learn)
- Google BigQuery
- Jupyter Notebook
